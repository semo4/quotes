As a child matures, he sees death and pain everywhere about him, and begins to lose faith in the ultimate goodness of man.

Both because of and in spite of his awareness of the meaninglessness of life, he can forge a fresh sense of purpose and affirmation. He may not recapture the same pure sense of wonder he was born with, but he can shape something far more enduring and sustaining. The most terrifying fact about the universe is not that it is hostile but that it is indifferent; but if we can come to terms with this indifference and accept the challenges of life within the boundaries of death �\u20AC\u201C however mutable man may be able to make them �\u20AC\u201C our existence as a species can have genuine meaning and fulfillment.

It smells of ten thousand restaurants, five thousand temples, shrines, churches and mosques, and of hunderd bazaar devoted exclusively to perfume, spices, incense, and freshly cut flowers.
